# Draggable2
==============================

Draggable adds drag and drop sorting to custom fields and custom statuses.

Drag categories to the right to nest them below others


## Notices
- Javascript required (please report IE issues on github)
- Currently only works with default database prefix of exp_

*__Note:__ Draggable has been merged into another addon of mine, 
Facelift, which adds additional functionality to the admin interface beyond drag and drop sorting.*
